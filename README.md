## Usage

``` 
* Clone repository
* To view tests in web console load: tests.html into your browser.
* To run app load index.html in your browser.

```
## Still to do

* I still feel that the testing modules could be better encapsulated.
* I have been having an issue in one of my tests that checks if there is string within HTML, on the page. For some reason it is returning that the array of html elements does not have the function forEach which seems odd as it is an array of objects.
* Up to challenge 7 so would like to complete the rest.

# Writing a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript (further JS)

## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

* Are you having fun?

* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

* **Can you write a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript?**

#### Secondary goal

To help you towards your primary goal, your secondary goal will be to produce a diagram of how all the parts of your notes app interact.

* Draw the diagram on Tuesday.
* Each morning, update the diagram with your latest understanding.

Your diagram might include: model, view, controller, external API, browser page, unit tests, feature tests, static server, node, XMLHttpRequest, the DOM.

### Concepts

* Frontend, [single page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/dn463786.aspx) web apps.
* Events and event handlers.
* Manipulating the [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).
* Ajax.
* Frontend templating.
* Frontend routing.

### Sequence & Schedule
* [Onsite](../sequence/onsite/week07.md)
* [Remote](../sequence/remote/week07.md)

## Tracks

This week is composed of two separate tracks.  You'll choose one track and stay on it for the whole week.

* In the [challenge track](00_challenge_track.md), you'll work in changing pairs as normal.  You'll implement an app using challenges to guide you (no walkthroughs). And you'll extract a test framework from your app.

* In the [project track](project_track.md), you'll work in small teams for the whole week.  You'll implement the same app as the challenge track, except you'll only use user stories to guide you (no challenges, no walkthroughs). You'll extract a testing framework, too.

## Get started

Have a look at the materials for each track.  Choose which one you want to do.  Once you get your pair or group assignment, you can get started.

It's going to be exciting!
